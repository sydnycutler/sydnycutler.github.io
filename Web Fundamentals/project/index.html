                subscribe to the dry oar
                philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the
                beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>

            <p class="home-paragraph-2">That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all.
                We believe that that
                tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate
                the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.</p>
