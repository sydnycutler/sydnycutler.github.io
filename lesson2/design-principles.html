    <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
    <h3>Gucci</h3>

    <p>When you first come to Gucci's homepage, you see a girl laying on the floor. She is sporting a white lace blouse, which is most likely one of Gucci's products. But in your mind, if you were to draw a tic-tac-toe shape across the photo, you would see that Gucci is using the Rule of Thirds. The girl's face fall right in line with where the right and bottom lines would cross. The rule of thirds always applies to where the lines would cross. And if you can make the subject of a photo fall in those spots, it will always make the photo more interesting and draw in your audience.</p>

    <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
    <h3>Purple</h3>

    <p>Purple is a good example of white space and clean design. In this picture, you can see that there are mainly two colors, white and purple. This presents a very clean design as you are able to take in the information as a consumer without distractions or the feeling of being cluttered. They also keep everything very clear and easy to read. The white space is also very important so that the audience can feel like they can breathe. I feel like Purple does a very good job with this.</p>

    <h2>Contrast</h2>
    <h3>Quiksilver</h3>

    <a href="https://www.quiksilver.com/">Quiksilver.com</a>
    <p>Contrast can take a boring photo and turn it into something interesting. On this Quiksilver page, we see a girl who is wearing a teal sweatshirt with a small emblem of a rainbow and peace sign. And then behind her are muted versions of the colors on her sweatshirt. This provide contrast because at first your eyes are drawn to the emblem and then soon after you look at the contrast of colors behind her. It becomes a very dynamic and impactful photo. Especially with the white that surrounds the photo.</p>
