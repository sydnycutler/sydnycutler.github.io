        I am living in Utah. I grew up in Northern California in El Dorado Hills and San Jose. I moved to Utah for
        school. I met my husband here and now we have a five month old daughter. My parents now live in a little town in
        Utah called Parowan. And my in-laws are in Riverton, Utah.

        I served my mission in Southern California, Bakersfield to be exact. So I have lived all over the state of
        California.
