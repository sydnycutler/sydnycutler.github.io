            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <h3>Color Palette</h3>
            <p>Palette URL:<a href="https://coolors.co/43271c-42bd78-9d5624-d4cb86-fefdfe" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/43271c-42bd78-9d5624-d4cb86-fefdfe</a>

                    <th>Primary</th>
                    <th>Secondary</th>

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <h4>Heading Font: Lobster Two</h4>
            <p>It is a very close font to the font on my logo and I would like for things to match so that I don't have so many different looks.</p>
            <h4>Paragraph Font: Montserrat</h4>
            <p>My heading font is cursive and I wanted a sans-serif to compliment it. I also liked how this text spreads out a little more than the <em>Lobster Two</em> font. It gives a good contrast.</p>
            <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
            <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, the Chocolate River Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
            <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
            <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, the Chocolate River Rafting Company can make it happen for you.</p>
