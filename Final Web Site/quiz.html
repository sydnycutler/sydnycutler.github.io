        <p>Hold Fast Knives are handcraft and unique. No two knifes are like each other. However, there are different styles of knifes that can be made. There are EDC (every day carry) knives, hunting knives, bushcraft knifes, camping knives, and even kitchen knives. And the fun doesn't stop there we also have different types of wood for the base of your knife including ash, cherry, hickory, mahogany, maple, oak, pine, rosewood, and walnut.</p>
