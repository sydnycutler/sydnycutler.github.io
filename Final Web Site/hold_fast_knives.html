            Hold Fast Knives is a custom handmade knife shop. We use the very best materials and craftmanship to create knives that meet the demands you would expect of a high-quality knife. We guarantee our knives with a Lifetime Warranty, because we believe in the integrity of our products. Each knife has been thoughtfully designed and engineered by hand. Blending the right properties to stainless steel will ensure that your knife has the right hardness and strength. Heat-treating or tempering the blade helps the knife hold its edge longer and makes it easier for you to re-sharpen the blade. Every knife is unique and will accompany you in all your everyday needs.
